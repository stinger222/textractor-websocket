== Build

[source,sh]
----
# This builds both executable for testing and dynamic library
cargo build
----

== Installation

Copy compiled .dll to the Textractor directory and add it in the Extensions page.

== Usage

After installing the plugin, it will automatically start a server at link:ws://0.0.0.0:6677[]

NOTE: Webserver starts lazily and ignores first two buffers, _viz._ Clipboard and Console.
That means that you will have to select a buffer you wish to and capture at least 
one line to start the server.

You will also need a UI, here is an example you can use: https://github.com/sadolit/textractor-websocket-webui[Example]
